Display copy protected PDF documents in WordPress pages and posts.

== Description ==

This plugin enables the use of copy protected PDF documents in WordPress posts and pages. The resulting embedded PDF object is supported in the ArtisBrowser and others that still support NPAPI plugins. However the option to allow select browsers remains so that intranets using older browsers can be allowed access.

CopySafe PDF provides the most secure protection for PDF both online and offline. This plugin displays PDF created for use online and when domain lock is applied, the PDF file cannot be displayed from anywhere else. With PDF now bound to your web site, you are free to apply DRM rules to control access to the page via your CMS member controls. The ArtisBrowser reports the user's unique computer signature so that you can convert WordPress into a fully fledged DRM Portal by adding a new field to your member's table and some script to compare current ID with the one already assigned.

* Easy install (requires WP Classic Editor).
* Insert protected PDF into posts and pages using the [PDF] media button.
* Upload and embed secure PDF using WordPress native media tools.
* Embeds objects dynamically using JavaScript.
* Set varying levels of protection per page or post.
* Detects PDF plugin version for redirection and installation.
* Settings to control width and height of the browser reader area.
* Safe from Print Screen and all screen capture software.
* PDF documents cannot be saved and displayed away from your website.

== Implementation ==

Click on the [PDF] media button above a post to upload and embed CopySafe PDF documents in your current post or page. When inserting a protected PDF object, the necessary shortcode is automatically inserted into the post editor. 

You can upload new PDF class documents or select from a list of already uploaded documents. After selecting a document you can then set the security options to apply to the page such as:

* Disable protection from PrintScreen and screen capture.
* Disable the option to view from computers using remote or virtual connections.
* Disable printing or set a print limit per session.**

** To extend print count beyond the current session, you need to implement some DRM rules and monitor prints per user/document.

== Screenshots ==

1. CopySafe PDF documents can be added at the last position of the cursor by clicking the [PDF] button.
2. Once the document is selected, you can then nominate settings to apply to this particular page or post.
3. The above default settings are applied to all CopySafe PDF pages and posts.
4. The document file manager will list all uploaded document class files.
